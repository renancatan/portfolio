    <h2>&nbsp;Current challenges in my company</h2>
    <p>
    &nbsp; When I assumed responsibility for the purchasing department, I began collaborating with the development team
    to create web scrapings and crawlers.
    <br>
    &nbsp; Our goal was to monitor competitor pricing, enabling us to make more informed, margin-boosting purchase
    decisions.
    <br>
    &nbsp; We implemented alerts for low prices and various other metrics, utilizing Python and SQL for these tasks.
    <br><br>

    &nbsp; Subsequently, I adopted Airflow to manage our data pipelines, further enhancing our capabilities by integrating
    report generation through the Google Sheets API.
    <br>
    &nbsp; We also explored rapid prototyping of applications within the Google ecosystem.
    <br>
    &nbsp; This approach allowed us to test new ideas in a more agile and cost-effective manner, circumventing the need
    for extensive development.<br><br>

    &nbsp; In parallel, I developed multiple automation processes to alleviate manual workloads across different teams.
    <br>
    &nbsp; This effort included integrating third-party APIs to access vital information, such as product stock levels
    and sales conditions.<br><br>

    &nbsp; Most recently, I embarked on constructing our company's Data Warehouse single-handedly.
    <br>
    &nbsp; The inaugural data mart
    I established focuses on customer orders.
    <br>
    &nbsp; I am responsible for its continual update, employing SQL queries and
    &nbsp; leveraging Airflow's scheduling capabilities.
