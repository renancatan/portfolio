    <h2>&nbsp;Hello, I'm Renan Catan.</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp; At the core of my professional journey lies a profound enthusiasm for development,
        with a particular emphasis on Python, SQL, Airflow, and Data Warehouse technologies and a little of js/ts.
        <br>
        &nbsp; My expertise in Python and SQL has been a cornerstone in my career, enabling me to develop robust data
        solutions.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp; With Airflow, I've streamlined complex data workflows, enhancing efficiency and reliability.
        <br>
        &nbsp; My starting experience with Data Warehouses has furthered my ability to manage and analyze large datasets
        effectively as well create DW/DM from scratch.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp; In addition to these technical skills, I bring three years of rich experience in Data Analysis.
        <br>
        &nbsp; My journey began as a Data Analyst, where I specialized in machine learning, and gradually evolved into a
        role that seamlessly integrates software development and data engineering.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp; As a Mechanical Engineer, I've always approached problems with a data-driven mindset.
        My proficiency extends to data visualization, analytical thinking, and a Kanban-oriented work methodology.
        <br>
        &nbsp; Driven by challenges and a passion for innovation, I am dedicated to leveraging my diverse skill
        set in Python, SQL, Airflow, and Data Warehouse to create impactful data and software solutions.
        <br><br>
